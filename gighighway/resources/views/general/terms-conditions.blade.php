If you do not agree to accept, comply with, and be legally bound by any of the terms and conditions contained in this User Agreement, which include those terms and conditions expressly set out in the outline below, as well as those incorporated by reference, please leave this Site immediately.

            <h3>1. Introduction.</h3>
            <p> GigHighway operates this website for the purpose of providing online booking opportunities for talent, artists, performers, musicians, talent managers, talent agents, talent promoters, event planners, event service providers, consumers, and buyers and sellers of entertainment and event services. GigHighway.com helps agents, talent and entertainment buyers, and consumers (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Clients") find entertainment and event services for their private events, public events, corporate events, or weddings. GigHighway.com is a website used by Clients to search for, find, and hire entertainment and event services such as live bands, DJs, music entertainers, string quartets, dance entertainment, comedians, impersonators, magicians, photographers, party rentals, and other entertainment and event services (hereinafter referred to as "Vendors" or "Members"). Vendors offering services and Clients purchasing services share full responsibility for making sure events originating through GigHighway are exciting and run smoothly. The GigHighway website acts as a "matchmaker" for buyers and sellers of entertainment and event services, allowing Clients to buy and sell entertainment and event services directly from Vendors, without the use of a middleman. It must be understood that GigHighway has limited control over the quality, safety or legality of the services advertised on the Site and has no involvement in the actual booking of entertainment or event services, and therefore assumes no responsibility or liability for any injury, loss, or damage that may occur as a result of any agreement reached between GigHighway Vendors and Clients.</p>
